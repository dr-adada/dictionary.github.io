Dictionary App
A simple and user-friendly dictionary app built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
# Usage
Enter a word in the search bar and hit the search button. The app will display the definition(s) of the word.
# Note
The app uses an API to fetch the definitions and may, thus, be limited to the words contained in that API.
